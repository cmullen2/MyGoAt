// how to access PID elems for each event.


// why would it use ntracks to fill? This would be a problem for the wire chamber stuff.


What is it doing?

flags for reconstruct all cb photons, and all taps photons.
Loops round getNtracks for this! then fills. See the prefilling allocation in processeventwithoutfilling and notice that the cluster energy is filled from tracks.
