//Look in TA2Goat for chamber1X#
//find that and the bit that has Get inters from fmwpc
// using the type TA2MWPCInterserction

fInters is all intersections and intersection candidates, need to determine what justifies a candidate.

I think the problem is in TA2Goat.cc with the following line:
        for(Int_t i=0; i<nChamberHitsin1; i++) //Does this work correctly???

where the relevant info is 	nChamberHitsin1 = fMWPC->GetNinters(0);
